This mod adds waffles, as well as wafflemakers and batter. The waffle batter  
is put into the waffles maker, cooked, and turns into a waffle. That waffle  
can then turn into 4 smaller waffles.  


**Mod Contains:**
*	Wafflemaker
*	Toaster (homedecor toaster if homedecor is present)
*	Package of Toaster Waffles
*	Toaster Waffle
*	Slice of Bread
*	Toast
*	Large Waffle
*	Small Waffle
*	Waffle Batter (in a can)
	
**How the Wafflemaker Works:**
*   Place a wafflemaker
*	Punch it to open
*	Hold a can of batter, and punch the wafflemaker
*	Punch again to close
*	After 5 seconds, the wafflemaker will open with a cooked waffle
*	Punch again to retrieve waffle

**How the Toaster Works:**
*   Place a toaster
*	Hold some bread or a package of toaster waffles
*	Punch the toaster
*	Punch again to start toasting

*	Punch again to retrieve
	
**Important stuff:**
*	A can of waffle batter can only be used 3 times
*	A package of toaster waffles yeilds 6 toaster waffles (3 uses on toaster)
*	The wafflemaker has a different recipe if homedecor is enabled
*	If homedecor is enabled, this mod will not register a toaster. Use the  
	homedecor toaster
*	The wafflemaker produces a *large* waffle, which gives you 8 hp  
	(four hearts) when eaten
*	The large waffle can be placed in your crafting grid to produce  
	4 *smaller* waffles
*	Each small waffle gives you 2 hp (one heart)
*	Each toaster waffle gives you 4 hp (two hearts)

There are separate models, but only one is obtainable from the creative inventory.  
**DO NOT** place waffles:wafflemaker_closed_full if you have used /giveme. It is
not diggable and can only be removed with worldedit or an admin pick.  
**Warning:** If you leave the world while a wafflemaker or toaster is cooking, it  
will be stuck that way when you return (worldedit/adminpick required).
