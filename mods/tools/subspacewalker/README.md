The mod contains a tool that allow you to go trough blocks. If the tool is active you are in a Subspace bubble, so the real blocks around you are not there and you can walk trough them.

How to use:
- You need to hold the Subspace Walker tool in the hand and use them (right-click) for activation.
- Sneaking results in a lower Subspace and you go downwards.
- Jumping bring the nodes below you back to outside Subspace so you can go upwards
- To disable the Subspace Walker Tool just try to place it (left click) or take something other in the hand
